# Covid-19-Website
This is a covid-19 website using Python Flask, HTML, and CSS. This site pulls data from an API then transform that data into a bar graph representing: Total Confirmed Positive , Total Confirmed Recovered, Total Deaths from Covid-19.


Looks like the owner of the API is no longer providing this information. I will have to look for a new API to pull these data from.
